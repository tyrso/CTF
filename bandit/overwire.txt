tips: 
command:"find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null"
-user: for finding the file owned by user
-group: for finding with group
-size: for finding with size
and 2>/dev/null: for direct the error(like permission denied) to /dev/null
2 is for type2 i/o flow(stands for wrong output)
> for redirect
/dev/null will dump all the content you write into
and finally use cat the/given/path read the file
note:sometimes you can use cat to find the file through path
but can't use cd through path,this is due to the permission which cd needs is write but cat only needs read
